# SQL
Examples of the SQL queries I created (PostgreSQL; Clickhouse). The queries are organized based on the dataset:

    airbnb: join, CTE, subqueries, aggregate functions  (Clickhouse)
    
    avocado_sales: window functions, aggregate functions (Clickhouse)

    installs_checks_devices: join, subqueries, aggregate functions  (Clickhouse)
    
    templates_selected: window functions, CTE, conditional expressions, aggregate functions (PostgreSQL)
    
    transactions: aggregate functions, CTE, window functions (Clickhouse)
