# SQL
Examples of the SQL queries I created (PostgreSQL; Clickhouse)
The queries are organized based on the dataset:

         **templates_selected.sql** - window functions, CTE, conditional expressions, aggregate functions (PostgreSQL)

              **avocado_sales.sql** - window functions, aggregate functions (Clickhouse)

               **transactions.sql** - aggregate functions (Clickhouse)

     **installs_checks_devices.sql** - join, subqueries, aggregate functions  (Clickhouse)
